Convert photos and videos to artwork

Using this we can stylize any photo or video in style of famous paintings using Neural Style Transfer.

### About
Neural Style Transfer was first published in the paper "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style" by Gatys et al., originally released in 2015. It is an image transformation technique which modifies one image in the style of another image. We take two images of content image and style image, using these two images we generate a third image which has contents from the content image while styling (textures) from style image. If we take any painting as a style image then output generated image has contents painted like style image.
