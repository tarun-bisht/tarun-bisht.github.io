Create crappy artifacts in images

### About
DeepDream is image modification algorithm an example of generative deep learning that uses representation learned by convolution neural networks to modify images. It was released by Google in 2015. The popularity of deepdream caused due to its crappy artifacts in images, from eyes to feathers to dog faces. It was initially created to help scientists and engineers to see what a deep neural network is seeing when it is looks given input.
