Saload is a unity asset to save and load data efficiently into games.

## Why use Saload?

* __Security of game data__: Save Game data securely into binary file which is harder to read and spoof.
* __Dealing with big Chunks of data__: Deal with big chunk of data easily by wrapping all data into a class and saving its state, also data can be easily loaded into that class object.
* __Easy to use__: Easily save and load data by its key. Also it is easy to use with custom classes of data.
* __Track__: Easily track which keys have been saved yet.

__(note: To be able to track the saved custom created objects use .saload extension to the binary file name while saving data.)__
