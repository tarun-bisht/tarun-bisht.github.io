Saload is a unity asset to save and load data efficiently into games.

## Why use Saload?

- **Security of game data**: Save Game data securely into binary file which is harder to read and spoof.
- **Dealing with big Chunks of data**: Deal with big chunk of data easily by wrapping all data into a class and saving its state, also data can be easily loaded into that class object.
- **Easy to use**: Easily save and load data by its key. Also it is easy to use with custom classes of data.
- **Track**: Easily track which keys have been saved yet.

**(note: To be able to track the saved custom created objects use .saload extension to the binary file name while saving data.)**
