This project is an interative web demo for Genetic Algorithm, This algorithm that is inspired from biological evolution of organism. It is a search-based optimization technique based on the principles of Genetics and Natural Selection. From population of an organism we select organism with best fitness and crossover between them to form new generation of organism with traits inherited from their parents along with some mutations. This demo try to create given target word from random words by evolving itself after number of generations. Problems which can take years to solve by simple Bruteforce can be solved in seconds or minutes with Genetic Algorithm. This demo can be used to teach someone about Genetic Algorithm also it can be helpful to visualize how algorithm behaves on tuning or changing parameters like Mutation Rate and Population Size.
