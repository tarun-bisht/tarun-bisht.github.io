Modern responsive website theme with modern elements. I am using this theme for my own personal website.

## Created With

- HTML
- SCSS
- JavaScript
  All SCSS files are compiled to CSS files using live sass compiler plugin in VSCode. Compiled CSS along with minified compiled CSS are included in repository.

## Features

- Modern UI elements
- Fully responsive
- Support for both light and dark theme with javascript
- Animations support and can be controlled using attributes in html elements
- do not require other 3rd party dependencies to work like jquery, bootstrap etc.
- Image preloading (all images are not loaded at start they are loaded when visible this reduce website loading time)
- easily customizable
