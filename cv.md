### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

#### Research Co-Coordinator &#124;  The Sound of AI OSR, Remote &#124; 2020 - Present

Initiated the application of transformers in automatic speech to text module of NeuralNet music synthesizer which is an open-source research project with team of voluntary researchers and software professionals around the world, achieved decrease in error rates of output text from model by 20% by fine tuning, applying data augmentation and adding decoding algorithms to model output.

#### Academic Research &#124; Kumaun University, Nainital &#124; (2020)

Created a cheap alert system for monkey theft detection, accomplished low error rates by using state of art detection algorithms at that time, increased detection fps from 1 to 24 by converting trained model to tensorflow lite which enabled the system to be deployed in a raspberry pi, also provided software solution for previously installed ip cameras.

#### Research Scholar &#124; National Children Science Congress (NCSC) &#124; (2010-2012)

Actively presented research experience papers in NCSC, The research topics include Land resources: use for prosperity save for posterity and Energy: explore, harness and conserve.

### WORK EXPERIENCE

#### Co-Founder and Developer &#124; The Gamer Studio &#124; (2017 - 2019)
